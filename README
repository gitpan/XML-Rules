XML-Rules

This is yet another XML module built on top of XML::Parser:Expat.

It allows you to specify "rules", subroutines to be run once a tag
is fully parsed and either process the data from the tag itself
and its children or specify what parts of the data and how to add
to the data structure being built for the parent tag.

You may look at this either as a XML::Simple on steroids, a way
to build a more customized datastructure out of your XML or as yet
another even based XML parser that differs from the rest in that it
handles building the structure(s) containing the needed data for you,
simplifying the callbacks.
